This module focuses on a basic introduction to the following topics

1. #### Basic elements of modern computer architecture

2. #### How to optimize a scientific computing code, running on a single-core.

   We give some basic directions, plus a bibliography which should help you going deeper.

3. #### Introduction to parallelism

   What parallel computing is, why we need it.
   The definition of fundamental concepts and of the architecture and usage of a modern parallel cluster.
   Shared- and Distributed Memory paradigms.
   Some elements on how parallel performance is defined

4. #### Introduction to shared-memory parallelism via OpenMP

   Introduction to fundamental concepts.
   Parallel regions.
   Dealing with shared- and private- data.
   Basic elements of appropriate synchronization of threads.
   Loops.

5. #### Introduction to code debugging and profiling

   Usage of gdb on serial and multi-threadedcodes
   Usage of perf and valgrind as profiling tools

You find here the slides and materials from this 1-week course.

Take into account that this is the first module in a plan that includes:

**A. Basic Introduction to HPC (this module, 1 week)**
**B. Distributed Memory (MPI, 1 week)**
**C. Advanced parallelism (OpenMP and MPI, 1 week)**
**D. GPUs (3 days)**
